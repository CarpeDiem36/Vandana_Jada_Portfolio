This project aims to classify famous Avengers cast members into their respective roles, focusing on five characters: Black Widow, Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor. The project has been structured into three main components: a user interface, a server, and a data preparation folder containing the Python notebooks used for dataset cleaning and model building.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model building
- Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code as IDE
- Python Flask for HTTP server
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface

## Folder Structure
- `UI`: This folder contains the code for the user interface website
- `Server`: This folder contains the code for the Python Flask server
- `Data_Prep`: This folder contains the Python notebooks used for dataset cleaning and model building
- `Dataset`: This folder contains the dataset used for the model training

By classifying Avengers cast members into their roles, this project can help fans and movie producers understand how each actor embodies their character's traits and behavior, and potentially inform future casting decisions.

# Machine Learning Churn Prediction: Identifying Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company - https://github.com/VandanaJada/MachineLearning_ChurnPrediction

In this repository, we have performed an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify characteristics of customers that are more likely to churn in a telecommunications company. We have used these insights to create a machine learning model, and finally, deployed the model.

## Conclusion from EDA
Here are some quick insights from our EDA:

- Customers who use electronic check as their payment medium are the highest churners.
- Monthly contract customers are more likely to churn due to no contract terms, as they have more flexibility to switch.
- Customers with no online security and no tech support are high churners.
- Non-senior citizens are more likely to churn.

## Machine Learning Model
We have used a Random Forest Classifier as our machine learning model to predict customer churn. The model achieved an accuracy of 94% on our dataset.
